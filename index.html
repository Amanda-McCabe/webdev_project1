    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Hello, I am Amanda McCabe.</h3>
    <p>I am currently working to become a software engineer. I live in Nampa, Idaho.</p>
    <p>As a former healthcare professional, I have always had an interest in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helping people</li>
      <li>Making people smile</li>
      <li>Making life easier</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, I am taking that passion and shifting it to software engineering. I am looking forward to helping people and enriching lives by making software that makes life easier. If I can do so in a way that is fun and makes people smile, even better.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning coding on Coursera.</p>
    <p>I am loving learning from and working with other engineers. I am excited to start my career as a software engineer.</p>
    <p>I am very much a nerd. I love things like anime, cosplay, board games, and video games.</p>
    <p>I also love to write, draw, sing, dance, and spend time with my kids.</p>
    <p>I do also like outdoor adventures, such as camping, hiking, and rock hounding.</p>
    <p>I would love to hear from anyone wanting to hire a new engineer. As well as from anyone wanting to work on a project and build great software together.</p>
    <h3>Have a great day!</h3>
