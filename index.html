    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hello, I am Amanda McCabe.</h2>
    <p>I am currently working to become a software engineer. I live in Nampa, Idaho.</p>
    <p>As a former healthcare professional, I have always had an interest in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helping peopel</li>
      <li>Making people smile</li>
      <li>Making life easier</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, I am taking that passion and shifting it to software engineering. I am looking forward to helping people and enriching lives by making software that makes life easier. If I can do so in a way that is fun and makes people smile, even better.</p>
